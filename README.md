</p>

Efficient procedures for constrained likelihood estimation and inference with truncated lasso penalty (Shen et al., 2010; Zhang 2010) for linear, generalized linear, and Gaussian graphical models. 

Currently this package is in active development and will be released very soon.
## New features [Unreleased]

This version supports regression from summary statistics and out-of-core model fitting using an ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte datasets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's highly optimized and much more memory-efficient as compared to existing penalized regression packages like [**glmnet**](https://github.com/cran/glmnet) and [**ncvreg**](https://github.com/pbreheny/ncvreg/). 

- Add regression with summary data input

- Add inference function

- Add OpenMP support

- Add external memory computation support

- Add sparse coefficient matrix output

- Add implementation of Poisson regression

## Highlights

constrained likelihood approach, inference

an improved algorithm 

any GLM

summary data

big data, memory management

visualization
