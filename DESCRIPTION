Description: Extremely efficient procedures for constrained likelihood estimation and inference with truncated lasso penalty for linear, generalized linear, and Gaussian graphical models. This version supports regression from summary statistics and out-of-core model fitting using an ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte datasets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's highly optimized and much more memory-efficient as compared to existing penalized regression packages like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg'.
