Description: Extremely efficient procedures for constrained likelihood estimation with truncated lasso penalty for linear, generalized linear, and Gaussian graphical models. This version is a completely new version compared with our previous version, which was mainly based on R. New core algorithms are developed and are now written in C++ and highly optimized.
